UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM:

Write a function that plays a single round of rps
The function should take two parameters 1. playerSelection 2. computerSelection
Then then return a string that declares a winner of the round. example: "You lose! Paper beats rock

* The playerSelection function should be case-insensitive
* Account for ties by re-playing the round 


PLAN:
The overall goal is to create a function that plays the game of RPS.
The function lets call if rockPaperScissors will have 2 parameters (playerSelection and computerSelection)
playerSelection has not been created but computerSelection has

sub problems:
1. create the game function called playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection):
*the parameters will set the game in play
*input will come from the other funcions (playerSelection and computerSelection)
*write the logic for rps (if and thens)
*write the expected outputs

2. create playerSelection input:
*get input from user. users selects paper, rock, or scissors
*make the input case-insensitive
*return their choices


ACTIONS:
*I will start on the playerSelection function. 

PSEUDOCODE: 
*pseudocode for playerSelection function

where is my input coming from? 
it will come from the user.
program will ask "rock, paper, or scissors?"

is the input in the function or outside the function?
use chatgpt or other tools to answer this question: I will keep it outside the function

what will be done with this input?
I will store it in a variable. The program needs to make the input case insensitive.
make variable case insensitive.

what will my output be?
the output will be the users selection.
return users choice 






if the input isn't rock paper or scissors return "invalid"
